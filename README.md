# N languages in N weeks
 
 This is a project repository for following the Seven languages in seven weeks and Seven more languages in seven weeks -books. You can find the books here:
 * https://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks
 * https://pragprog.com/book/7lang/seven-more-languages-in-seven-weeks
 
 The books are structured to introduce one language in one week in a breadth first strategy. We learn the syntax, but also what makes the language different from other languages.
 
 Repo follows the books' structure by splitting into languages, days and tasks.
